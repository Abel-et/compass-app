# Compass 

This folder contains a packaged build and a few helper files for the Compass feature/app.

Quick summary
- What it is: a mobile Compass build (APK) and small supporting files.
- Purpose of this README: explain what is in this folder and simple steps to inspect or install.

Contents
- base.apk — Android package of the Compass app (signed/unsigned; check before installing).
- Name                            Id.txt — a short text file (open with any text editor).
- Location_pointer/ — a directory (likely contains resources or code related to location pointer features).

Safety first
- Only install APKs you trust. If you don’t know the origin, inspect the APK before installing.
- On Android devices, enable "Install unknown apps" only for the installer you trust and disable it afterwards.

Simple actions

1) View the text file


2) Inspect the APK (recommended before installing)
- On a computer:
  - unzip: unzip base.apk -d base_apk_contents
  - or use a decompiler/viewer: jadx, apktool, or Android Studio's APK Analyzer to inspect resources and manifest.
- Check AndroidManifest.xml for required permissions and the app's package name.

3) Install the APK on a device
- Using adb (recommended for testing):
  - adb install -r Compass/base.apk
- Or transfer to device and open with a trusted installer (allow unknown sources if required).
- After testing, remove the APK and disable unknown-source install permission.

Developer notes
- If you want the source code or a rebuildable project, the APK must be replaced with project sources (Gradle/Android Studio or React Native/Flutter source).
- The Location_pointer folder likely holds additional resources or code—open it to see exact files.

If you want, I can:
- Open and paste the contents of the text file here.
- List files inside Location_pointer.
- Give step-by-step commands to decompile and inspect base.apk safely.
